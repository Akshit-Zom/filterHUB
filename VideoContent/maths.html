              <p>Division is a basic arithmetic operation that involves splitting a number into equal parts or groups.
                To divide one number by another, you need to perform the following steps:         
                Write the dividend (the number being divided) on the left side of the division symbol ("/").
                Write the divisor (the number doing the dividing) on the right side of the division symbol.
                Divide the divisor into the first digit of the dividend, and write the result (the quotient) above the dividend digit.
                Multiply the quotient by the divisor, and write the result below the dividend digit.
                Subtract this result from the first digit of the dividend, and bring down the next digit of the dividend to the right of the result.
                Repeat steps 3 to 5 until you have divided all the digits of the dividend.
                Write the final result as a whole number with any remainder written as a fraction or decimal.</p>

                <p>Algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with mathematical operations and symbols, usually represented by letters, to solve equations and analyze mathematical relationships. It is a tool that allows us to solve complex problems and answer important questions by using variables to represent unknown values. Algebra is used in various fields such as science, engineering, finance, and economics to model and analyze real-world phenomena. It involves a range of topics, including algebraic equations, inequalities, functions, graphs, and matrices. Overall, algebra plays an essential role in modern mathematics and is a fundamental skill for many professions.</p>

It is a fundamental concept in calculus, analysis, and other areas of mathematics, and is used to model relationships between variables, express mathematical operations, and solve problems.
                      Functions can be represented in different forms, such as algebraic expressions, graphs, tables, and verbal descriptions. They can be classified by their properties, such as their domain, range, continuity, differentiability, and periodicity. Common types of functions include linear functions, quadratic functions, polynomial functions, trigonometric functions, exponential functions, logarithmic functions, and more.</p>

                      <p>Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics that deals with the relationships between the sides and angles of triangles. It is widely used in fields such as engineering, physics, navigation, and surveying, among others. The three primary trigonometric functions are sine, cosine, and tangent, which are used to find the missing side lengths or angles of a triangle given certain information about the triangle. Trigonometry also involves other functions such as cosecant, secant, and cotangent, which are reciprocals of the primary functions. Trigonometry can also be used to solve problems related to periodic phenomena, such as waves and oscillations, and to model the behavior of various physical systems.</p>

                        <p>Multiplication is a mathematical operation that involves combining two or more numbers to produce a single result, called a product. It is a fundamental arithmetic operation that is used in many areas of mathematics, as well as in everyday life.</p>

                            <p>To convert a decimal to a fraction in mathematics, follow these steps:
                              Write the decimal as a fraction with the decimal value as the numerator and a power of 10 as the denominator (the power of 10 depends on the number of decimal places).
                              Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor.

                              <p>In mathematics, the number of triangles that can be formed depends on the given set of points or lines.

                                If you are given a set of n points in a plane, with no three points collinear (lying on a single straight line), then the number of triangles that can be formed by connecting any three of these points is given by the formula nC3, where nC3 represents the number of ways to choose 3 points from n. In other words, the number of triangles that can be formed is the combination of n objects taken 3 at a time.</p>

                                <p>The hand trick for multiplication is a simple and effective way to remember and quickly recall the times tables for numbers 1 through 10.

                                  Here's how it works:
                                  
                                  Hold out both hands in front of you with palms facing up.
                                  Assign each finger a number, starting with the left pinky as 1 and ending with the right pinky as 10.
                                  To multiply, touch the corresponding fingers on both hands and count the number of fingers that are touching. For example, to multiply 3 and 4, touch the left ring finger (3) to the right index finger (4), and count the number of fingers touching on both hands. You should get 1 thumb (representing 10) and 2 fingers (representing 2). So 3 x 4 = 12.
                                  For numbers greater than 10, use the thumb of one hand to represent 10, and then count the remaining fingers on that hand and the fingers on the other hand. For example, to multiply 8 and 9, touch the left middle finger (8) to the right ring finger (9), and count the number of fingers touching on both hands. You should get 7 fingers (3 on the left hand and 4 on the right hand) and 1 thumb (representing 10). So 8 x 9 = 72.</p>
